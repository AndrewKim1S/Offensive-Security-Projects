###################### Elf File Infector (Prepending) #########################

The virus must copy itself into the program of other elf files. It does this by
copying the virus to a tmp file. Then copy the target elf to tmp file. Add a 
signature for virus detection (so it doesn't self infect). We can then rename
the tmp file as the original binary

new binary structure:
 _______
|       |
| Virus |
|_______|
|       |
|  ELF  |
|_______|
|       |
|  sig  |
|_______|

Steps:
1. Find a clean (non-infected elf) to infect
2. Copy the virus, target executable, and signature to tmp file (replace original)
3. If argv[0] is not original src virus, run original target code. 
  - lseek to start of host elf. copy to tmp file
	- fork, execv tmp file
	- delete the tmp file
4. execute virus payload
